**About**

When I’m not designing things I like to play music, write computer programs, write things that are not computer programs, meditate, be in nature, make and eat food, sleep and dream, be around loving people. While I often travel for work, I mostly work remotely. For the past 25 years people have paid me to do some kind of digital design. Product design has been my focus since 2012. While I grew up in the Seattle area, I have had family connections and spent time in both Tucson and Kihei throughout my life. I conintue to spend time in all three locations each year and find inspiration in the contrasting natural environments of the Sonoran Desert, the Pacific Northwest and Maui. 

I’m not able to share a lot of my most recent design work, but I have a portfolio of past work I can make available upon request. 

You can find some recent music I made with friends available on [Bandcamp](https://othersleep.bandcamp.com/album/d-mic).

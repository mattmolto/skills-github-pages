When Iâ€™m not designing things I like to play music, write computer programs, write things that are not computer programs, meditate, be in nature, make and eat food, sleep and dream, be around loving people. While I often travel for work, I mostly work remotely. For the past 25 years people have paid me to do some kind of digital design. Product design has been my focus for more than 10 years now.
